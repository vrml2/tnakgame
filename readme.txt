2.0 QuickStart
---------------
	2.1 Users with CosmoPlayer

		For users with the plugin already installed on their system, setup is easy:

		* Insert Diskette into your floppy drive

		* Open the file 'tnakgame.wrz' on the disk

	2.2 Users without CosmoPlayer

		This setup requires slightly more processes. You will need access to an Internet connection to download the CosmoPlayer install file.

		* Go to www.cosmosoftware.com in your web browser and download the appropriate plugin for your Operating System (CosmoPlayer is available for Win 95/98/3.1 and MacOS)

		* Find the downloaded install file and run it. Chose the appropriate Browser to install the plugin for when prompted. 

		* See instructions for users with CosmoPlayer

2.3 Playing TnakGame
	To start a quick game: 	
	* Click the 'generate' button, (wait while the terrain randomly generates, this may take some time). 
	* Click the appropriate button for the number of players.
	* Click the 'play' button
	* Use the 'page up' and 'page down' keys to change between the default viewpoints, or use the CosmoPlayer controls to move about in the world.
	* Click and drag on the ovals on the left of the display to change the angles and velocity for the current tank (the color of the display matches the current tanks color).
	* Press the fire button when you have finished calibrating your angles.
	* The last player alive on the map wins.

3.0 Running off the Hard Disk/Backup
-------------------------------------
	It's easy to back this program up to your Hard Drive or some other form of data storage. Simply copy all files on the disk to another location. If you intend to use this as Backup, I suggest you also backup the CosmoPlayer install file.
